# tool-zabbix

In this project I will share part of my work with zabbix.
There are some nice templates, some performance tips, etc.

I am a great fan of Linux, Python, Ansible, Docker and DevOp stuff in general. So you will find this content here. : )

# TEMPLATES #

## MBSEC-DRBD ##
I wrote this template during my researches and labs with DRBD. I liked so much this technology then I put in production with a Cheap and HighPerformance cluster of KVM managed with oVirt. The project used Ceph, DRBD, oVirt, NFS, LVM and Pacemaker with very cheap hardware.
DRDB was a key technology for this project, but it was a litle boring to adjust it. Also, the monitoring part of it is not pratical. So, I wrote this Zabbix tamplate to help me. : )

Please, take a look at README for more details.
