This template was developed by Marcus Burghardt at MBSEC.

It monitor the DRBD servives, their synchronizations status and their connections status.
It was tested and homologated in CentOS7 and RHEL7, but is very possible to work well with other SystemD distros. Or you can easily adapt it.

Installation:
    1 - Import the XML to Zabbix.

    2 - Adjust the SUDO permissions for Zabbix Agent user. This user will execute the commands at /etc/zabbix/scripts.
    scp sudoers.d/mbsec_zabbix_drbd root@<drbd server>:/etc/sudoers.d/

    3 - Send the files drbd_queryResource.py and drbd_resourceDiscovery.py to the monitored server, at /etc/zabbix/scripts:
    scp zabbix_scripts/drbd_resourceDiscovery.py root@<brbd server>:/etc/zabbix/scripts/
    scp zabbix_scripts/drbd_queryResource.py root@<drbd server>:/etc/zabbix/scripts/

    4 - Send the file mbsec_drbd.conf to the monitored server, at /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/
    scp zabbix_agentd.d/mbsec_drbd.conf root@<drbd server>:/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/

    5 - Restart the zabbix-agent service
    systemctl restart zabbix-agent

    6 - Assign this tamplate to the monitored host.
    7 - Wait some minutes and check the data.

TIPS:
To manually test, use this commands:
1 - From Zabbix Agent host:
zabbix_agentd -t mbsec.drbd.discovery

2 - From Zabbix Server host:
zabbix_get -s <drbd server> -p 10050 -k mbsec.drbd.discovery
